# RemarkaBot

Fetch your documents from Telegram to your Remarkable 2!

Project status: Work In Progress (stay tuned :P)

## Installation

### Create your Telegram bot

First, you need a Telegram bot.
To be responsible for who can send you documents, it can receive them only from groups.

Create it using ``@BotFather``. 
Please enable ``/setjoingroups`` and add the bot to the desired groups (or create a new one).

``/setprivacy `` disabled could also be useful to send documents to it without mentioning it inside the message.

After adding it to the desired groups, disable ``/setjoingroups``.

## Usage

## Contributing

Every contribution is welcomed. 
The official repository is on GitLab (https://gitlab.com/mollofrollo/remarkabot/), while a mirror exists on GitHub (https://github.com/Davide95/RemarkaBot).

Currently, we officially only support Remarkable 2. 
Anyway, any patch that will let the software run on Remarkable 1 is appreciated.

If you spot any bug, opening an issue could be useful to discuss it. 
If possible, it would be great to have a corresponding merge request with a unit test to spot the issue easily and to avoid any regression in the future.
