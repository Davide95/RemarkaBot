# RemarkaBot

Fetch your documents from Telegram to your Remarkable 2!

Project status: Work In Progress (stay tuned :P)

## Installation

In order to user `RemarkaBot` you need a Telegram Bot, you can create one using [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).  
For security reasons it's crucial that you are in control of the groups `RemarkaBot` accepts files from. To make sure nobody adds your `RemarkaBot` instance to some random (potentially malicious) groups we reccomend to block all group invitations after having added the bot to your groups. You can simply do that by sending `/setjoingroups` to `BotFather` and follow instructions. 
From now on to add `RemarkaBot` to other groups you must unlock group invitations and lock it again.   
Leaving the setting unlocked might be tempting, but **please** don't do that.

Consider to disable [Privacy Mode](https://core.telegram.org/bots#privacy-mode) to be able to use `RemarkaBot` without having to mention him.

## Contributing

Every contribution is welcomed. 
The official repository is on GitLab (https://gitlab.com/mollofrollo/remarkabot/), while a mirror exists on GitHub (https://github.com/Davide95/RemarkaBot).

Currently, we officially only support Remarkable 2. 
Anyway, any patch that will let the software run on Remarkable 1 is appreciated.

If you spot any bug, opening an issue could be useful to discuss it. 
If possible, it would be great to have a corresponding merge request with a unit test to spot the issue easily and to avoid any regression in the future.
