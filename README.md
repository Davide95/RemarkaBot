# RemarkaBot

Fetch your documents from Telegram to your Remarkable 2!

Project status: Work In Progress (stay tuned :P)

## Installation

### Telegram

In order to user `RemarkaBot` you need a Telegram Bot, you can create one using [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).  
Sending private messages to him is not allowed. For security reasons it's crucial that you are in control of the groups `RemarkaBot` accepts files from. To make sure nobody adds your `RemarkaBot` instance to some random (potentially malicious) groups we reccomend to block all group invitations after having added the bot to your groups. You can simply do that by sending `/setjoingroups` to `BotFather` and follow instructions. 
From now on to add `RemarkaBot` to other groups you must unlock group invitations and lock it again.   
Leaving the setting unlocked might be tempting, but **please** don't do that.

Consider to disable `/setprivacy` to send documents to `RemarkaBot` without having to mention him.
