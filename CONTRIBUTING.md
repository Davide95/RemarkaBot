# Contributing

Every contribution is welcomed. 
The official repository is on GitLab (https://gitlab.com/mollofrollo/remarkabot/), while a mirror exists on GitHub (https://github.com/Davide95/RemarkaBot).

Currently, we officially only support Remarkable 2. 
Anyway, any patch that will let the software run on Remarkable 1 is appreciated.

If you spot any bug, opening an issue could be useful to discuss it. 
If possible, it would be great to have a corresponding merge request with a unit test to spot the issue easily and to avoid any regression in the future.
